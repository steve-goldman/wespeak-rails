    <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

    <p>
      
      This Privacy Policy describes how and when WeSpeak collects,
      uses and shares your information when you use our
      Services. WeSpeak receives your information through our various
      websites, SMS, APIs, email notifications, applications, buttons,
      ads, and commerce services (the "Services" or "WeSpeak") and
      from our partners and other third parties. For example, you send
      us information when you use WeSpeak from our website. When using
      any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer,
      manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your
      information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of
      which country you reside in or supply information from, you
      authorize WeSpeak to use your information in the United States
      and any other country where WeSpeak operates.

    <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>

    <p>

      <strong>Basic Account Information:</strong> When you create or
      reconfigure a WeSpeak account, you provide some personal
      information, such as your username, password, and email
      address. Your username is listed publicly on our Services,
      including on your profile page and in search results. Some
      Services, such as search and public user profiles, do not
      require registration.

    </p>

    <p>

      <strong>Additional Information:</strong> We may use your contact
      information to send you information about our Services or to
      market to you. You may use your account settings to unsubscribe
      from notifications from WeSpeak. You may also unsubscribe by
      following the instructions contained within the notification or
      the instructions on our website. If you email us, we may keep
      your message, email address and contact information to respond
      to your request.

    </p>

    <p>

      <strong>Statements, Group Memberships, Following Lists, and
      other Public Information:</strong> Our Services are primarily
      designed to help you share information with the world. Most of
      the information you provide us is information you are asking us
      to make public. This includes not only the statements you create
      and the metadata provided with statements, such as when you
      created the statement, but also the statements you support and
      vote on, the groups you join, the groups you follow, and many
      other bits of information that result from your use of the
      Services. We may use this information to customize the content
      we show you, including ads. Our Services broadly and instantly
      disseminate your public information to a wide range of users,
      customers, and services. When you share information or content
      like photos, videos, and links via the Services, you should
      think carefully about what you are making public.

    </p>

    <p>

      <strong>Location Information:</strong> Some WeSpeak features are
      only available to users who choose to share their location with
      WeSpeak, such as groups whose participation is limited to a
      specific geographical region.  In these cases, you control
      whether your computer or mobile device sends us your
      location. We may also use other data from your device to
      determine location, for example, information about wireless
      networks or cell towers near your mobile device, or your IP
      address. We may use and store information about your location to
      provide features of our Services to improve and customize the
      Services, for example, with more relevant content like
      suggestions of nearby groups to participate in.

    </p>

    <p>

      <strong>Links:</strong> WeSpeak may keep track of how you
      interact with links across our Services, including our email
      notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by
      redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help
      improve our Services, to provide more relevant advertising, and
      to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many
      times a particular link was clicked on.

    </p>

    <p>

      <strong>Cookies:</strong> Like many websites, we use cookies and
      similar technologies to collect additional website usage data
      and to improve our Services, but we do not require cookies for
      many parts of our Services such as searching and looking at
      group profiles. A cookie is a small data file that is
      transferred to your computer's hard disk. WeSpeak may use both
      session cookies and persistent cookies to better understand how
      you interact with our Services, to monitor aggregate usage by
      our users and web traffic routing on our Services, and to
      customize and improve our Services. Most Internet browsers
      automatically accept cookies. You can instruct your browser, by
      changing its settings, to stop accepting cookies or to prompt
      you before accepting a cookie from the websites you
      visit. However, some Services may not function properly if you
      disable cookies. Learn more about how we use cookies and similar
      technologies here.

    </p>

    <p>

      <strong>Log Data:</strong> When you use our Services, we may
      receive information ("Log Data") such as your IP address,
      browser type, operating system, the referring web page, pages
      visited, location, your mobile carrier, device information
      (including device and application IDs), search terms, and cookie
      information. We receive Log Data when you interact with our
      Services, for example, when you visit our websites, sign into
      our Services, or interact with our email notifications.

    </p>

    <p>
      
      <strong>Third-Parties and Affiliates:</strong> WeSpeak uses a
      variety of third-party services to help provide our Services,
      such as hosting our various blogs and wikis, and to help us
      understand and improve the use of our Services, such as Google
      Analytics. These third-party service providers may collect
      information sent by your browser as part of a web page request,
      such as cookies or your IP address. Third-party ad partners may
      share information with us, like a browser cookie ID, website URL
      visited, mobile device ID, or cryptographic hash of a common
      account identifier (such as an email address).
      
    </p>
    

    <h3>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>

    <p>

      We do not disclose your private personal information except in
      the limited circumstances described here.

    </p>

    <p>

      <strong>Your Consent:</strong> We may share or disclose your
      information at your direction.

    </p>

    <p>
      
      <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We engage service providers
      to perform functions and provide services to us in the United
      States and abroad. We may share your private personal
      information with such service providers subject to
      confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy,
      and on the condition that the third parties use your private
      personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our
      instructions.

    </p>

    <p>

      <strong>Law and Harm:</strong> Notwithstanding anything to the
      contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your
      information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to
      comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the
      safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical
      issues; or to protect WeSpeak's rights or property. However,
      nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal
      defenses or objections that you may have to a third party’s,
      including a government’s, request to disclose your information.

    </p>

    <p>
      
      <strong>Business Transfers and Affiliates:</strong> In the event
      that WeSpeak is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition,
      reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold
      or transferred as part of that transaction. This Privacy Policy
      will apply to your information as transferred to the new
      entity. We may also disclose information about you to our
      corporate affiliates in order to help provide, understand, and
      improve our Services and our affiliates’ services, including the
      delivery of ads.

    </p>

    <p>
      
      <strong>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</strong> We may
      share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise
      non-personal information, such as your public user profile
      information, statements you create, statements you support, your
      votes on statements, the groups you participate in, the groups
      you follow, or the number of users who clicked on a particular
      link (even if only one did), or reports to advertisers about
      unique users who saw or clicked on their ads after we have
      removed any private personal information (such as your name or
      contact information).

    </p>

    <h3>Our Policy Towards Children</h3>

    <p>

      Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become
      aware that your child has provided us with personal information
      without your consent, please contact us at
      support@wespeakapp.com. We do not knowingly collect personal
      information from children under 13. If we become aware that a
      child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we
      take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's
      account.

    </p>

    <h3>Changes to this Policy</h3>

    <p>

      We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most
      current version of the policy will govern our use of your
      information and will always be at
      <%= link_to privacy_policy_url %>. If we make a change to this
      policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will notify
      you via an email to the primary email address associated with
      your account. By continuing to access or use the Services after
      those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the
      revised Privacy Policy.
